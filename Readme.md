## ‚ú® Added Value

Our development approach combines the best of both worlds to deliver a superior user experience and a robust architecture.

- **Hybrid Rendering (SSR + SPA)**
We've implemented a hybrid rendering approach for the products, blending the speed of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with the fluidity of a Single-Page Application (SPA).

Initial Load: Products are rendered on the server, ensuring the first page loads quickly and is fully indexed by search engines for optimal SEO.

```js
    const from = parseInt(req.query.from) || 0;
    const limit = parseInt(req.query.limit);
    const products = require('./data/products.json');
    const selectedProducts = limit ? products.slice(from, from + limit) : products;
    const html = await engine.renderFile('featured-products', { products: selectedProducts, settings: settings.sections });
    res.send(html);
```

Infinite Scroll: As the user scrolls, new products are fetched on demand via an offset and injected directly into the DOM. This provides a seamless SPA experience without requiring a full page reload, conserving both server and client resources.

```js
    const htmlString = await response.text();
    const doc = parser.parseFromString(htmlString, 'text/html');
    const newNodes = Array.from(doc.querySelectorAll('.product-card'));
    allProducts.push(...newNodes);
    __appendProducts(newNodes);
    offset += newNodes.length;
```


- **Smooth Transitions**
The user interface includes various subtle transitions, enhancing the overall user experience and making the site feel more polished and dynamic.
